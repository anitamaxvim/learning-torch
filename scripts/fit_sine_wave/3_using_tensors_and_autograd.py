"""
This implementation computes the forward pass using operations on PyTorch Tensors,
and uses PyTorch autograd to compute gradients.

A PyTorch Tensor represents a node in a computational graph. If x is a Tensor that
has x.requires_grad=True then x.grad is another Tensor holding the gradient of x
with respect to some scalar value.
